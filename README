😊 Smile for Attendance 👀
Face Authentication Based Attendance System

A real-time face authentication attendance system built using Python, OpenCV, and Streamlit.
The project allows students to register their face, punch in, and punch out using a live camera feed, with attendance automatically logged in a CSV file.

This project was designed with a focus on practical usability, clean UI, and real-world constraints such as lighting variations and state handling.

📌 Features

📸 Face registration using live camera

🧠 Face recognition using LBPH algorithm

🕒 Punch In / Punch Out attendance system

👥 Multiple student support

📄 Attendance stored in CSV format

🎨 Streamlit-based aesthetic and interactive UI

🔁 Real-time updates without restarting the app

⚠️ Basic spoof prevention via live camera input

▶️ How the System Works
1️⃣ Face Registration

User enters UID and Name

Camera captures multiple face samples

Images are stored in a unique folder:

dataset/UID_Name/

2️⃣ Face Recognition

LBPH model is trained on all registered faces

Live camera feed is compared against trained data

Recognized faces are matched with UID & Name

3️⃣ Attendance Marking

Punch In → records time in PunchIn

Punch Out → updates PunchOut

Attendance is stored in a structured CSV file

🧪 Sample Attendance Format
S.No	UID	Name	Date	PunchIn	PunchOut
1	22BCS101	Kemee	2026-01-29	01:25:46	---
2	22BCS105	Shashi Tharoor	2026-01-29	02:10:12	03:05:30
🧠 Key Implementation Snippets
Face Detection (OpenCV)
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.3, 5)

Face Recognition (LBPH)
label, confidence = recognizer.predict(face_img)
if confidence < 80:
    uid, name = label_map[label]

Attendance Logging
rows.append([serial_no, uid, name, today, punch_in_time, ""])

🖥️ Running the Project
